A case study of health tracking data for Google Data Analytics Certificate

## Intro
In this case study, I am a junior data analyst who is working for the marketing analytics team at Bellabeat, a high-tech company that designs health tracking products for women. This hypothetical scenario is provided by Google's Data Analytics Certificate Program through Coursera, and I will be outlining the standard data analysis pathway throughout this project (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act).

## Files
The project folder HeatlhTracking contains the folllowing:
#### *data* folder
The data for non-Bellabeat devices was downloaded from Kaggle user MÃ¶bius: Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data. This data collection contains 18 CSV files about exercise activity, intensity, calories, steps, METS (metabolic equivalent of task), heartrate, weight, and sleep across different time measurements (days, hours, minutes, seconds).

The original datasets were created by Furberg, R. et al, published on Zenodo in May 2016. It is open-sourced with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License. The data is based on a 2016 crowdsourced survey of Fitbit users, conducted by Amazon Mechanical Turk.
