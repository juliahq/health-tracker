# health-tracker
A case study of health tracking data for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

## Intro
In this case study, I am a junior data analyst who is working for the marketing analytics team at Bellabeat, a high-tech company that designs health tracking products for women. This hypothetical scenario is provided by Google's Data Analytics Certificate Program through Coursera. I will be outlining the standard data analysis pathway throughout this project (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act).

## About the data
The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle user MÃ¶bius: [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). This data collection contains 18 CSV files about exercise activity, intensity, calories, steps, METS (metabolic equivalent of task), heartrate, weight, and sleep across different time measurements (days, hours, minutes, seconds). When working on this project, I saved the CSVs within a *data* folder within the project folder.

The original datasets were created by Furberg, R. et al, published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.Yj5xAi-B3Z7) in May 2016. It is open-sourced with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License. The data is based on a 2016 crowdsourced survey of Fitbit users, conducted by Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Additional references are listed in the R markdown.

#### R Analysis Documents
* HealthTracking.Rmd -- full R documentation of data analysis, visualizations, summaries, trends, references
* HealthTracking.nb.html -- interactive preview of R markdown (can hide code chunks)
* HealthTracking.html -- stagnant R markdown document

#### Notes
To save space, I will not be uploading individual plot images. These can be viewed in the R markdown and HTML files and can be reproduced and individually downloaded by first creating an empty *plots* folder in the project folder, uncommenting the lines of ggsave, and re-running the code.
